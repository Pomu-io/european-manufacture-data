If you are using this function in a Scrapy component, and you are OK with users of your component changing the fingerprinting algorithm through settings, use crawler.request_fingerprinter.fingerprint() instead in your Scrapy component (you can get the crawler object from the 'from_crawler' class method).

Otherwise, consider using the scrapy.utils.request.fingerprint() function instead.

Either way, the resulting fingerprints will be returned as bytes, not as a string, and they will also be different from those generated by 'request_fingerprint()'. Before you switch, make sure that you understand the consequences of this (e.g. cache invalidation) and are OK with them; otherwise, consider implementing your own function which returns the same fingerprints as the deprecated 'request_fingerprint()' function.

If you are using this function in a Scrapy component, and you are OK with users of your component changing the fingerprinting algorithm through settings, use crawler.request_fingerprinter.fingerprint() instead in your Scrapy component (you can get the crawler object from the 'from_crawler' class method).

Otherwise, consider using the scrapy.utils.request.fingerprint() function instead.

Either way, the resulting fingerprints will be returned as bytes, not as a string, and they will also be different from those generated by 'request_fingerprint()'. Before you switch, make sure that you understand the consequences of this (e.g. cache invalidation) and are OK with them; otherwise, consider implementing your own function which returns the same fingerprints as the deprecated 'request_fingerprint()' function.

 'about_us': 'KIOXIK is a website dedicated for several years to the sale of '
             'clothing and textile accessories for hairdressers, where '
             'professionals can easily find everything they need for their '
             'business. With the headquarters located in Europe, we offer '
             'competitive service for fast deliveries across the continent. '
             'KIOXIK primarily focuses on selling towels for professionals, '
             'with black towels featuring an essential stain-resistant '
             'treatment for use with colorants, thus allowing for greater '
             'product durability. The towels are made of 100% cotton for '
             'better absorption; we use cotton because it is a 100% natural '
             'fiber that does not cause skin irritation for clients. The '
             'towels measure 50x83 cm with a weight of 350 gr/m2, which are '
             'the most requested characteristics worldwide. We also sell '
             'capes, gowns, and kimonos made of microfiber, a lightweight '
             'material that is easy to wash and resistant to laundering, '
             'providing great durability. The cape is adjustable with 3 snaps '
             'and measures 125x130 cm, while the gowns with sleeves are also '
             'adjustable with 3 snaps and measure: sleeves: 48 cm; Length: 1 '
             'm; back width: 65 cm. These products are treated with a '
             'waterproofing process so that water does not wet the client, and '
             'they also feature an anti-static treatment that is very '
             'important to prevent hair from sticking to the material. We also '
             'sell aprons made of polyurethane that are easy to wash, '
             'adjustable, and waterproof, making them suitable for use during '
             'color treatments by professionals. We work with major brands '
             'such as L’Oréal, Matrix, Redken, Kérastase, and Biolag.',

If you are using this function in a Scrapy component, and you are OK with users of your component changing the fingerprinting algorithm through settings, use crawler.request_fingerprinter.fingerprint() instead in your Scrapy component (you can get the crawler object from the 'from_crawler' class method).

Otherwise, consider using the scrapy.utils.request.fingerprint() function instead.

Either way, the resulting fingerprints will be returned as bytes, not as a string, and they will also be different from those generated by 'request_fingerprint()'. Before you switch, make sure that you understand the consequences of this (e.g. cache invalidation) and are OK with them; otherwise, consider implementing your own function which returns the same fingerprints as the deprecated 'request_fingerprint()' function.
