Our peshtemal towels are extremely light and take up very little space, making them the ideal travel companion. They also dry quickly, making them more environmentally friendly and durable. Softness is one of the most important aspects of a peshtemal: its organic fabric structure doesn’t irritate sensitive skins and it doesn’t leave marks and scratches. It’s ideal also for baby care. Our peshtemals are made using 100% organic cotton loomed in a traditional wooden machine. They maintain their shape and texture and they get softer and more absorbent as you wash them. Choose from our selection of peshtemal products to find the one that suits you best.

Additionally, many people are still exploited through low wages and poor working conditions. Marathon.R feels the urgency to do this differently and wants to demonstrate that quality can go hand in hand with fairness and sustainability.

He conducted the first systematic studies in this area by creating models and patterns of traditional garments that were becoming scarce in their regions. At the same time, he initiated the first corporate folk dance costume rental business in Turkey. In 1994, he co-founded MATE KOSTÜM with Ergun EKMEKÇİOĞLU, continuing his work on a more corporate scale. Mate Kostüm has become a brand in the industry by producing not only regional costumes but also performance costumes such as period, stylized dance, ceremony, rond, and animation costumes.
